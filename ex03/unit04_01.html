			<p>Well done is better than well said.</p>
			<p>Seeing much, suffering much, and studying much, are the three pillars of learning. </p>
			<p>Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance. </p>
			<p>I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details.</p>
			<p>When all think alike, no one thinks very much.</p>
			<p>Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it. </p>
			<p>It's not that I'm so smart , it's just that I stay with problems longer.</p>
			<p>Theories should be as simple as possible, but not simpler. </p>
			<p>Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal.</p>
			<p>I never came upon any of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking. </p>
			<p>Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value. </p>
			<p>Gravitation cannot be held responsible for people falling in love.</p>
			<p>What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure. </p>
			<p>Sincerity is the way of Heaven. </p>
			<p>The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.</p>
			<p>While there's life, there's hope. </p>
			<p>Paradise is where I am. </p>
